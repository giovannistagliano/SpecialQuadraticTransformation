# SpecialQuadraticTransformation
This is the code I used in the paper "*Examples of special quadratic birational transformations into complete intersections of quadrics*", https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsc.2015.11.004, to construct some new examples of birational transformations of projective spaces whose base locus scheme is smooth and connected. The most relevant example is that of a Cremona transformation of **P**<sup>8</sup> not defined along a smooth threefold scroll over a quintic del Pezzo surface.

Note that this is an old code, written in 2015 for *Macaulay2* version 1.7. Today these examples can be easily obtained using the function `specialQuadraticTransformation` of the *Macaulay2* package *Cremona*.
